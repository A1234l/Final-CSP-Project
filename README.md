**Purpose:**

The purpose of this game/site is to help any tourist or inhabitant in the San Diego area to be able to plan the perfect and most optimal route that can help them save time and gas money, making the trip easier for them.

**How to use the Site:**

You will first start off at the homepage where you are prompted to either play the game for the best route or to use the navigation bar to navigate around the site. When you hit play, you are then navogated to another page where the actual game takes place.

When you are navigated to the actual game page, you must hit play, which will then prompt the user with a carousel slider that contains a wide variety of locations and is the main way that the user will be creating their route planner. 

After the locations they wish to visit have been selected, the user will then need to submit these locations and a map with the places they selected appear as points on the map and the user needs to connect them all with a single line for their interpretation of the "most optimal" route. The computer will then make its own optimal path and compare them and assign the user the score that they gained. 

The user then could submit their score to the leaderboard and compare themselves with other users who have previously used the site. It will also display the locations they selected as a way to keep track of the locations they wanted to visit. 

**How does this work (on a technical scale):**

The site is built on github pages and uses html, markdown, javascript, python and SASS as a way to make the page interactive. The site utilizes a backend server storing multiple apis that are used and called on by the website.

Some of the apis used in this site include the API for the leaderboard and the API for the login page.
