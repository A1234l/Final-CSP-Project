## Planned Activities
> Group events will occur each afternoon.  These are intended to explore local area attractions and build family bonds.

### Tuesday Morning
> Greet Games by Johnner and family.  Volleyball, Basketball, and Swimming have been generational sports for the Leuck's.  Early Leuck outings were to Tyler Texas and swimming was an all afternoon event.  At one time, almost all the Leuck's were in Eugene Oregon and many holidays were spent at the Danebo Church playing ball. Later their were reunions at Silver Creek Falls, Mexico, and Wenatchee. So in Leuck tradition, the morning will start with sports and of course socializing.  The theme of the 1st sports activity day will be: play, socialize, eat, rinse, and repeat.
- The facility has a field and Volleyball net
- Half-Court basketball
- Bocce Ball
- Pool

### Thursday Boating in Shifts (Jared)
> Boating at the Lake.  In the Eugene days the family had several boating trips at the surrounding lakes.  UJ (Frank's brother) was the center of many of these trips.  Picking up for UJ, Jared is coordinating a boating adventure ...

This is a water sport boat.  It has a high performance boat (v8 power) with wakeboard tower that can pull a large wakeboarder, skier, tuber, and is even equipped for wake-surfing.  Jared has a ski/wakeboard rented for all day Thursday 6/29.  

OG families are asked to contribute $135.  This cost can be distributed to those who plan to participate.  We will need to obtain a head count for each of the four sessions.  We want to limit trip to 8 people at a time.
